            Out In Business is a newly revived LGBTQ+ student organization at Northeastern! During the spring of 2020, 3 students came together with the goal of forming a queer community within the business school. Through speaker events, workshops, and social outing we want to help every LGBTQ+ individual within the D'amore-McKim break into, and succeed within, the business world.

            OIB's events rest on three pillars: personal development, community engagement, and professional relations. Through workshops and student mentors, members of OIB can hone both their hard and soft skills. Social events and community service opportunities can connect members of the club with the larger queer community on campus and in Boston. Speaker events and professional mentors help OIB members learn how to best break into the business world and navigate unique challenges.

To reflect the accepting and open community we want to cultivate, OIB is open to all LGBTQ+ individuals as well as allies who are interested in business.
